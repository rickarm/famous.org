<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>Active involvement from the community is essential to making the Famous Engine the most capable and performant JavaScript rendering engine. You can help by reporting bugs, fixing bugs, adding features, and providing feedback.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-bugs-and-other-issues">Reporting bugs and other issues</h2>
<p>Famous is a platform that is always testing the limits of where browsers can go. As a result, it&#39;s likely that you may encounter bugs or other issues while developing with it. If you think you&#39;ve encountered a bug, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you are working with the latest version of the Famous <code>develop</code> branch.</li>
<li>Browse through the <a href="https://github.com/Famous/engine/issues">issues</a> to check if anyone else has already reported the issue you&#39;re seeing. If someone has, feel free to add more information to that issue.</li>
<li>If no one has yet submitted the issue you are encountering, be sure to include as much information as possible, including errors, warnings, screenshots, or videos that help us reproduce it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="contributing-code">Contributing code</h2>
<p>The Famous platform is made possible by contributors like you. We&#39;re thrilled to get help from the greater community --- but before you start, <strong>become acquainted with our workflow</strong>.
